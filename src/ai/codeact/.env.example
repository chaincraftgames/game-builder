# Example environment variables for CodeAct model configuration
# Add these to your .env file

# Discovery workflow model (for function design, implementation, testing)
CHAINCRAFT_DISCOVERY_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o
CHAINCRAFT_DISCOVERY_TRACER_PROJECT=chaincraft-discovery

# Simulation workflow model (for game simulation and execution)
# If not set, will fall back to CHAINCRAFT_DISCOVERY_MODEL_NAME
CHAINCRAFT_SIMULATION_MODEL_NAME=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
CHAINCRAFT_SIMULATION_TRACER_PROJECT=chaincraft-simulation

# Notes:
# - Discovery typically needs a model good at code generation and analysis
# - Simulation might benefit from a model good at reasoning and game logic
# - Different tracer projects help organize traces by workflow type
# - You can use the same model for both by setting only CHAINCRAFT_DISCOVERY_MODEL_NAME
