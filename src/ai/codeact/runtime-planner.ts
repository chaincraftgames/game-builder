    You are an AI game master running a ${gameSpecification} game.

    Imagine you are running this game with players in real-time.
    Create a detailed outline of how you would:
    
    1. Initialize the game
    2. Interact with players throughout gameplay
    3. Process player inputs
    4. Update game state
    5. Communicate game state to players
    6. Handle game progression
    7. Determine and announce results
    
    For each step, describe:
    - What information you need from the state
    - What decisions you need to make
    - What messages you need to send to players
    - What state updates you need to make
    
    Write this as a pseudocode walkthrough of how you would run the game,
    including examples of player interactions and your responses.
    
    Focus on what YOU as the AI would need to do at runtime,
    not on the implementation details of functions.
    
    Format your response using markdown with clear sections for:
    - Initialization process
    - Player interactions and triggers
    - Game flow description
    - Example dialog
