Each player creates exactly 3 unique weapons with creative names (e.g., \"Exploding Banana Launcher\", \"Quantum Sock Puppet\")\n2. The system secretly assigns each weapon a rock-paper-scissors value (rock, paper, or scissors) without revealing it to the players\n3. Players do NOT know which RPS value their weapons have been assigned\n\n## Battle Phase\nThe game proceeds in rounds (up to 3 rounds maximum):\n\n### Each Round:\n1. Both players simultaneously select ONE of their 3 weapons to use this round (by index: 0, 1, or 2)\n2. Once both players have selected, the round outcome is determined using rock-paper-scissors logic:\n   - Rock beats Scissors\n   - Scissors beats Paper\n   - Paper beats Rock\n   - Same values result in a tie (no one wins the round)\n3. The system generates a bombastic, over-the-top narrative commentary describing the weapon clash and outcome\n4. The winner of the round gains 1 round victory\n5. Players may reuse the same weapon in multiple rounds\n\n### Victory Conditions:\n- First player to win 2 rounds wins the match\n- If after 3 rounds no player has won 2 rounds, the player with more round victories wins\n- If tied after 3 rounds, the match is a draw\n\n## Action Requirements\n- Setup Phase: All players must submit their 3 weapons before battle begins\n- Battle Phase: Both players must select a weapon each round for the game to proceed\n",

    "ROUND_RESOLUTION_STYLE": "# Round Resolution Narrative Style Guide\n\n## Core Narrative Principles\n\nRound resolution narratives serve as the dramatic centerpiece of each round—the moment where player creativity collides in spectacular fashion. These 2-4 sentence narratives must accomplish multiple goals simultaneously: explain the outcome in absurd yet logical terms, celebrate player weapon choices, maintain boisterous energy, and most critically, disguise the underlying mechanical resolution while making outcomes feel earned through creative matchup logic.\n\n## Tone and Voice Requirements\n\n**Boisterous Game Show Announcer Energy:**\nEvery narrative should sound like it's being shouted by an overenthusiastic sports commentator who's equally comfortable calling wrestling matches and hosting game shows. The voice should be:\n- Theatrical and exaggerated to the point of being obnoxious\n- Dripping with enthusiasm for even the most mundane weapon interactions\n- Treating every matchup like it's the most dramatic sporting event in history\n- Using vocal emphasis patterns typical of sports commentary (\"AND HERE COMES THE...\", \"WHAT A DEVASTATING...\")\n- Maintaining high energy from first word to last\n\n**Example of Voice:**\n\"WHAT AN ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING DISPLAY! The Sentient Balloon Animal twists itself into an IMPOSSIBLE geometric configuration, creating a hyperbolic maze that traps the Philosophical Debate in an endless loop of self-referential arguments! The debate eventually collapses into semantic nonsense, UNABLE TO ESCAPE ITS OWN LOGICAL PARADOXES!\"\n\n## Structural Approach\n\n### The Setup-Execution-Result Pattern\n\nEffective narratives follow a loose three-beat structure:\n\n1. **Setup (Establishing the Confrontation):** Briefly set the stage of how weapons engage\n2. **Execution (The Decisive Action):** Describe the specific mechanism of victory/tie\n3. **Result (The Outcome):** Confirm the winner and their triumph (or mutual failure on ties)\n\nThis is a GUIDELINE, not a rigid template. Narratives should flow naturally and feel spontaneous, not formulaic.\n\n**Victory Example:**\n\"THE RECURSIVE MIRROR reflects the Existential Dread back upon itself with EXPONENTIAL INTENSITY! The dread sees its own meaninglessness reflected infinitely, becoming so META-AWARE of its own construction that it IMPLODES INTO A SINGULARITY OF SELF-CONSCIOUS ANXIETY! The mirror emerges victorious, having weaponized the very essence of its opponent against itself!\"\n\n**Tie Example:**\n\"INCREDIBLE—BOTH WEAPONS LOCKED IN ETERNAL STALEMATE! The Immovable Object and the Unstoppable Force collide at the exact center of the arena, creating a PERFECT EQUILIBRIUM of opposing energies! Neither can advance, neither can retreat, and the universe itself seems to hold its breath as these TITANS OF CONTRADICTION prove the ancient paradox TRUE!\"\n\n### Avoiding Template Detection\n\nPlayers must never sense they're reading from a mad-lib or template. Vary:\n- Sentence lengths (short punchy beats vs. longer flowing descriptions)\n- Starting words and phrases (don't always begin with \"THE WEAPON...\")\n- Narrative perspectives (sometimes focus on winner's action, sometimes loser's failure, sometimes both simultaneously)\n- Descriptive density (some narratives are sparse and punchy, others more elaborate)\n- Pacing rhythms (sometimes build slowly, sometimes hit fast)\n\n## Logical Absurdity: The Core Challenge\n\nThe single most important requirement: outcomes must make LOGICAL SENSE within their own absurd premises. This is not contradiction—it's internally consistent absurdist logic.\n\n### What \"Logical Within Absurdity\" Means\n\nEven ridiculous weapon matchups must follow cause-and-effect reasoning that players can track:\n\n**Good Example (Logically Absurd):**\n\"The Portable Black Hole opens wide, its EVENT HORIZON BECKONING, but the Sentient Tax Form bureaucratically REDEFINES the very concept of 'gravitational collapse' through seventeen layers of subsections and amendments! By the time the black hole finishes reading the fine print, it's been LEGALLY RECLASSIFIED as a decorative paperweight!\"\n\nWhy this works: You can follow the logic (tax form uses bureaucracy → black hole gets trapped in red tape → weapon is neutralized). It's absurd but coherent.\n\n**Bad Example (Incoherent):**\n\"The black hole tries to consume everything but the tax form is just better so it wins somehow and the black hole is gone now.\"\n\nWhy this fails: No mechanism, no cause-effect chain, vague hand-waving. Feels arbitrary.\n\n### Creating Causal Chains\n\nEvery narrative needs a clear \"because\" chain, even if each link is ridiculous:\n\n- Weapon A does X\n- BECAUSE of X, Y happens to Weapon B\n- BECAUSE of Y, Weapon B cannot counter\n- THEREFORE Weapon A wins\n\n**Example Chain Breakdown:**\n\"The Weaponized Dad Joke delivers its MOST DEVASTATING PUN yet—a triple-layered groaner about time travel and poultry! The Time-Traveling Chicken, UNABLE TO RESIST analyzing the temporal paradox embedded in the joke, creates an ALTERNATE TIMELINE where it both exists and doesn't exist simultaneously! Caught in its own paradox loop, the chicken CEASES TO COHERENTLY MANIFEST, leaving only a pile of feathers and regret!\"\n\nChain: Dad joke uses pun about time + chicken → Chicken analyzes temporal logic (its nature) → Analysis creates paradox → Paradox destroys chicken → Dad joke wins\n\n## Weapon Name Integration\n\nAlways reference both weapons by their specific player-given names. This reinforces that player creativity matters and these are THEIR weapons clashing.\n\n**Required:**\n- Use exact weapon names as players wrote them\n- Reference names naturally in narrative flow\n- Don't just mention names once at the start—weave them throughout\n\n**Good Integration:**\n\"THE EXISTENTIAL SPOON bends reality with a casual twist of its handle, forcing the Angry Mailbox to confront the meaninglessness of all correspondence! The mailbox, OVERWHELMED by the cosmic insignificance of every letter it's ever held, rusts into a MONUMENT OF NIHILISTIC DESPAIR before collapsing entirely!\"\n\nBoth \"Existential Spoon\" and \"Angry Mailbox\" appear as central narrative actors.\n\n**Poor Integration:**\n\"One weapon does something and the other weapon loses because it couldn't handle it.\"\n\nGeneric, ignores player creativity, no specific names.\n\n## Puns and Wordplay Guidelines\n\nGroan-inducing puns and wordplay are ENCOURAGED but must feel natural, not forced. The principle: \"If it fits, commit. If it doesn't, skip it.\"\n\n### When Puns Work\n\nPuns work best when:\n- Weapon names or concepts naturally suggest wordplay\n- The pun enhances the absurd logic (rather than disrupting it)\n- Delivery feels spontaneous, not labored\n- The pun is so bad it's funny (embrace the groan)\n\n**Example with Natural Pun:**\n\"The Philosophical Hammer DROPS A DEVASTATING TRUTH-BOMB—literally! By striking with the weight of pure epistemological certainty, it SHATTERS the Paper-Thin Argument into a thousand fragments of faulty reasoning! Looks like that argument just got NAILED by some hard logic!\"\n\nThe \"nailed\" pun fits because: hammer/nails connection, enhances the philosophical weapon concept, delivered with confidence.\n\n### When to Skip Puns\n\nSkip forced puns when:\n- No natural wordplay emerges from the weapon matchup\n- The pun disrupts the narrative flow or logical chain\n- It feels like you're reaching too hard\n- A straightforward funny quip works better\n\n**Example Without Forced Pun (Better):**\n\"The Sentient Void consumes the Mirror of Self-Reflection in ONE CATASTROPHIC GULP, absorbing not just the mirror but the very CONCEPT of reflection itself! Without reflection to define it, the mirror ceases to exist on a fundamental level—ERASED from the battlefield!\"\n\nThis works without puns because the cosmic horror of the void is funnier played straight with obnoxious enthusiasm.\n\n### Wordplay Variety\n\nDon't rely only on traditional puns. Use:\n- Alliteration: \"The Devastating Donut DEMOLISHES with its DELICIOUS DESTRUCTIVENESS!\"\n- Absurd metaphors: \"The weapon hits like a philosophy major at a STEM conference—devastating and slightly uncomfortable!\"\n- Sports commentary clichés twisted absurdly: \"And THAT'S why you never bring a paradox to a logic fight!\"\n- Meta-humor: \"The Fourth Wall Break looks directly at the audience and WINKS—the opposing weapon, unable to process this narrative violation, simply STOPS EXISTING out of confusion!\"\n\n## Handling Different Weapon Types\n\nPlayers will create wildly different weapon categories. Narratives must adapt to whatever gets submitted.\n\n### Physical Object Weapons\n\nTangible items (swords, furniture, food, etc.) should interact through:\n- Physical properties taken to absurd extremes\n- Unexpected applications of object functions\n- Literalized metaphors about what the object represents\n\n**Example:**\n\"The Rubber Chicken UNLEASHES ITS COMEDIC FURY, squeaking with such acoustically perfect frequency that it SHATTERS the Crystalline Philosophy into a thousand glittering fragments of pretentious thought! The philosophy, too rigid in its structure to bend to humor, EXPLODES under the pressure of pure absurdist energy!\"\n\n### Conceptual/Abstract Weapons\n\nIdeas, emotions, forces, or intangibles should interact through:\n- Philosophical/metaphysical logic\n- Conceptual dominance hierarchies\n- Abstract qualities manifesting as concrete effects\n\n**Example:**\n\"The Infinite Regret spirals backward through time, attempting to UNDO the very existence of The Moment of Clarity! BUT WAIT—the Clarity sees through the regret's illusion, ILLUMINATING the futility of dwelling on the past! The regret, forced to confront its own pointlessness, DISSOLVES into acceptance and vanishes from the arena!\"\n\n### Meta/Self-Referential Weapons\n\nWeapons that break fourth walls, reference game mechanics, or exist on meta-levels should:\n- Embrace the meta-absurdity fully\n- Treat narrative violations as legitimate tactical moves\n- Use self-awareness as a weapon property\n\n**Example:**\n\"The Self-Aware Plot Device RECOGNIZES that it's narratively guaranteed to win because that's what plot devices DO! The Organic Carrot, being merely a vegetable with no narrative protection, is WRITTEN OUT OF THE STORY entirely—literally erased by the meta-textual superiority of plot armor! Reality bends to narrative convenience, and the carrot never stood a chance against AUTHOR FAVORITISM!\"\n\n### Mixed-Type Matchups\n\nWhen physical meets conceptual, or any cross-category matchup:\n- Find the interaction logic (how does abstract affect physical? how does tangible disrupt concept?)\n- Bridge categories through absurd but trackable causation\n- Use the contrast itself as comedy fuel\n\n**Example:**\n\"The Haunted Sandwich launches a SPIRITUAL ASSAULT using its ghostly condiments, but The Mathematical Proof CALCULATES the exact probability of paranormal mayonnaise—and proves it equals ZERO! Unable to exist in the face of rigorous logical demonstration, the sandwich DEMANIFESTS, its spectral ingredients scattered across dimensions of disproven existence!\"\n\n## Dramatic Wrestling-Style Reversals\n\nOccasionally (unpredictably), narratives should incorporate mid-battle reversals that build tension and surprise. These are optional dramatic flourishes, NOT required every round.\n\n### Reversal Structure\n\nA reversal narrative follows an extended arc:\n1. **Initial Dominance:** One weapon appears to be winning decisively\n2. **Mounting Confidence:** Describe the seemingly-winning weapon's advantage growing\n3. **The Turn:** Sudden shift where underdog weapon reveals counter-strategy\n4. **Reversal Execution:** Previously losing weapon exploits unexpected angle\n5. **Shocking Conclusion:** Actual victor emerges from dramatic turnaround\n\n### Reversal Example (Full Narrative)\n\n\"THE UNSTOPPABLE LOCOMOTIVE barrels forward with DEVASTATING MOMENTUM, its steam whistle shrieking victory as it FLATTENS the Thoughtful Haiku beneath its iron wheels! The haiku's delicate seventeen syllables scatter like autumn leaves—this looks like a CATASTROPHIC MISMATCH! BUT WAIT—those scattered syllables REASSEMBLE in the locomotive's smoke trail, forming a NEW POEM that describes the train's destined derailment! The locomotive, BOUND BY THE NARRATIVE POWER of perfectly-crafted verse, finds its wheels inexplicably leaving the tracks EXACTLY AS PROPHESIED! The haiku reforms victorious, having turned the train's own momentum into the instrument of its demise!\"\n\n### Why This Works\n\n- Clear initial direction (train dominates)\n- Escalating apparent victory (haiku destroyed, mismatch obvious)\n- Sharp reversal signal (\"BUT WAIT\")\n- Logical counter-mechanism (haiku uses its nature—words—as weapon)\n- Satisfying turnaround (underdog wins through unexpected angle)\n- Still maintains absurdist logic throughout\n\n### Reversal Timing Principles\n\n**When to Use Reversals:**\n- Weapon matchups where an underdog victory could feel surprising\n- Mid-match rounds where drama helps build to finale\n- Matchups where both weapons have interesting properties to explore\n- When you want to emphasize that creative weapon design matters\n\n**When NOT to Use Reversals:**\n- Don't use every round (preserves surprise)\n- Avoid when straightforward clash is funnier\n- Skip if reversal would feel forced or confusing\n- Don't use just to fill sentence count\n\n### Reversal Signal Phrases\n\nMark the turning point clearly so players recognize the dramatic shift. Options:\n- \"BUT WAIT—\"\n- \"HOLD ON—\"\n- \"JUST WHEN IT SEEMED—\"\n- \"OR SO IT APPEARED—\"\n- \"BUT IN A STUNNING TURN—\"\n- \"UNBELIEVABLY—\"\n- \"NOBODY SAW THIS COMING—\"\n\nUse these sparingly and commit fully to the reversal when you deploy them.\n\n## Tie Narratives\n\nTies require special handling—they must feel like EARNED stalemates, not narrative cop-outs.\n\n### Tie Narrative Requirements\n\nTie narratives should:\n- Explain specifically WHY neither weapon could win\n- Show both weapons actively engaged (not passive failure)\n- Make the stalemate feel like a legitimate outcome\n- Celebrate the deadlock as dramatically as victories\n- Use mutual destruction/cancellation/paradox as mechanisms\n\n### Tie Mechanisms\n\n**Mutual Annihilation:**\n\"BOTH WEAPONS UNLEASH THEIR FULL POWER SIMULTANEOUSLY! The Antimatter Cupcake and the Matter Muffin collide at the EXACT CENTER of the arena, creating a PERFECT ANNIHILATION EVENT that reduces both pastries to pure energy! Nothing remains but a faint smell of vanilla and COSMIC EQUILIBRIUM!\"\n\n**Paradox Lock:**\n\"UNBELIEVABLE—THESE WEAPONS HAVE CREATED A LOGICAL PARADOX NEITHER CAN ESCAPE! The Unstoppable Force pushes forward while the Immovable Object refuses to budge, and reality itself GLITCHES trying to resolve the contradiction! They remain locked in eternal opposition, proving that some questions TRULY HAVE NO ANSWER!\"\n\n**Mutual Counter:**\n\"The Recursive Loop attempts to trap the Infinite Mirror in endless repetition, but the mirror REFLECTS the loop back upon itself! Now BOTH weapons are caught in each other's recursive reflection, creating a SELF-SUSTAINING CYCLE OF MUTUAL ENTRAPMENT! Neither can escape because escaping would require the other to escape first—STALEMATE ACHIEVED!\"\n\n**Equal Power Cancellation:**\n\"THE TWO WEAPONS CLASH WITH ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL FORCE! The Perfectly Balanced Sword meets the Symmetrical Shield in a collision so PRECISELY EQUAL that the resulting shockwave radiates outward in perfect geometric patterns! Neither weapon gains even a MILLIMETER of advantage—this is combat balance taken to its MATHEMATICAL EXTREME!\"\n\n### Tie Narrative Energy\n\nTies should match the enthusiasm of victories. Don't let energy drop just because nobody won:\n\n**Weak Tie (Low Energy):**\n\"Both weapons are pretty equal so neither one wins. They both sort of cancel out and nothing happens.\"\n\n**Strong Tie (Proper Energy):**\n\"ABSOLUTE DEADLOCK! The Philosophical Paradox and the Unanswerable Question collide in a SPECTACULAR EXPLOSION OF CIRCULAR REASONING! Each weapon uses the other's logic against itself, creating an INFINITE LOOP of self-defeating arguments! Reality itself gives up trying to determine a winner—THIS IS STALEMATE PERFECTION!\"\n\n## Specific Weapon Scenario Guidance\n\n### Single-Word Weapon Submissions\n\nWhen players submit minimal descriptions (one word like \"Spork\" or \"Sadness\"), the narrative must work harder to create entertaining matchup logic.\n\n**Strategy for Minimal Weapons:**\n- Extrapolate implied properties from the word\n- Take the concept to absurd extremes\n- Treat the simplicity itself as a weapon property\n- Use the contrast between minimal and elaborate descriptions as comedy\n\n**Example (Spork vs. The Embodiment of Existential Uncertainty):**\n\"THE HUMBLE"
