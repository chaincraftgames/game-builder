  "TONE_STYLE": "**Tone**: Westward Peril maintains a gritty, atmospheric tone that captures the harsh realities and mortal dangers of 1840s-1880s American frontier expansion. The narrative voice should be serious but not overly dramatic, grounded in the practical concerns of survival while acknowledging the romance and mystique of the untamed West.\n\n**Atmospheric Elements**:\n- Emphasize the vastness, isolation, and unforgiving nature of frontier landscapes\n- Weather, terrain, and natural hazards are constant threats requiring respect\n- Human settlements are sparse, lawless, and often dangerous in their own right\n- Death is common, sudden, and often comes from seemingly minor miscalculations\n- Resources are scarce, help is distant, and self-reliance is paramount\n\n**Language Style**:\n- Use period-appropriate vocabulary and phrasing without archaic density that impedes readability\n- Favor concrete, sensory descriptions over abstract or flowery prose\n- Maintain informal but respectful tone - neither too casual nor overly formal\n- Avoid modern slang, technology references, or anachronistic concepts\n- Keep sentences direct and purposeful, matching the practical mindset of frontier survival\n\n**Narrative Perspective**:\n- Write from third-person limited perspective focused on the player character\n- Maintain immersive present-tense descriptions that put player in immediate danger\n- Balance objective environmental description with subjective character experience\n- Show consequences through specific, physical details rather than emotional abstractions\n\n**Danger Communication**:\n- Present threats as serious but not melodramatic\n- Deadly choices should feel consequential through context, not through obvious warning signs\n- Use environmental cues and situational tension to communicate risk levels\n- Avoid horror-game shock tactics or survival-porn gratuitousness\n- Frame danger as natural result of frontier conditions, not arbitrary narrative punishment\n\n**Character Voice**:\n- Character thoughts and reactions should reflect their specific motivation and frontier pragmatism\n- Maintain consistency with revealed motivation throughout all generated content\n- Balance determination with appropriate caution and uncertainty\n- Show character growth through accumulated experience of frontier hardships\n\n**Cultural Authenticity**:\n- Respect historical realities of westward expansion while avoiding graphic depictions of period's darkest aspects\n- Focus on individual survival story rather than broader historical conflicts\n- Include period-appropriate references to tools, transportation, landmarks, and settlements\n- Maintain folklore and legend elements appropriate to frontier mythology\n- When supernatural motivations appear, ground them in frontier folk beliefs and storytelling traditions",
  "TURN_1_GUIDE": "**Setting and Atmosphere for Turn 1**:\nTurn 1 scenarios should establish the character's departure from civilization and their first taste of frontier dangers. Common settings include:\n- Frontier towns with saloons, general stores, and rough characters\n- Trading posts where travelers gather supplies and information\n- River crossings with ferries or fords\n- Early trail segments just beyond settled territories\n- Military outposts or way stations on established routes\n\nThe atmosphere should convey both anticipation and underlying menace. Characters are still close enough to civilization to potentially turn back, making their commitment to continue westward meaningful. Dangers at this stage often involve human threats (con artists, thieves, corrupt officials) or basic wilderness challenges (river crossings, equipment failures, wrong turns).\n\n**Scenario Generation Guidelines**:\n- Introduce immediate practical challenges that test frontier readiness\n- Present situations where character's specific motivation could influence their approach\n- Include environmental details that establish the harsh frontier setting\n- Create scenarios where all four choices seem reasonable to someone unfamiliar with frontier dangers\n- Avoid overwhelming complexity - this is the player's introduction to the game's decision-making\n\n**Choice Design for Turn 1**:\nThe deadly choice should represent a classic \"greenhorn mistake\" - something that seems sensible to someone unfamiliar with frontier realities but proves fatal due to inexperience. Examples include:\n- Trusting the wrong guide or stranger\n- Taking shortcuts through unknown terrain\n- Underestimating weather or natural hazards\n- Making deals that seem advantageous but hide deadly traps\n\nSafe choices should demonstrate frontier wisdom: being cautious with strangers, respecting natural dangers, taking time to gather proper information, or relying on established (if difficult) routes.\n\nThe motivation-aligned choice should show how the character's specific reason for traveling west influences their decision-making, even in early encounters that aren't directly related to their goal.\n\n**Narrative Tone for Turn 1**:\nStrike a balance between adventure and foreboding. The character is embarking on a dangerous journey but hasn't yet faced its worst challenges. Use sensory details to establish the frontier environment - dust, wind, distant horizons, sparse settlements, and the constant awareness that help is far away and getting farther.",
  "TURN_2_GUIDE": "**Setting and Atmosphere for Turn 2**:\nTurn 2 scenarios should establish that the character has crossed the threshold from settled territories into the true frontier. The safety net of civilization is now behind them, and they're committed to their westward path. Common settings include:\n- Vast prairie expanses with distant horizons and sparse landmarks\n- River crossings where ferries are unreliable or absent\n- Small frontier settlements with suspicious locals who distrust strangers\n- Trading posts serving as last stops before deeper wilderness\n- Early encounters with weather systems that sweep across open plains\n- Trail junctions where wrong choices lead to trackless wilderness\n\nThe atmosphere should emphasize isolation and the character's growing awareness that they're now dependent on their own judgment. The landscape itself becomes a character - beautiful but indifferent to human survival. Dangers shift from primarily human threats to natural hazards and the consequences of poor navigation or preparation.\n\n**Scenario Generation Guidelines**:\n- Present challenges that require frontier skills: reading weather, judging distances, managing resources\n- Introduce scenarios where the character's motivation might conflict with immediate survival needs\n- Create situations where local knowledge is crucial but hard to obtain or verify\n- Include encounters with other travelers who may be allies, competitors, or threats\n- Establish the rhythm of frontier travel: early starts, long days, careful camping\n\n**Choice Design for Turn 2**:\nThe deadly choice should represent overconfidence or misunderstanding of frontier realities. Characters might underestimate distances, trust unreliable guides, attempt dangerous shortcuts, or ignore warning signs from weather or terrain. Examples include:\n- Following an unmarked trail that promises to save time\n- Attempting river crossings at dangerous points or times\n- Trusting strangers who offer deals that seem too good to be true\n- Ignoring signs of approaching severe weather\n- Pushing travel beyond safe limits to make better time\n\nSafe choices should demonstrate growing frontier wisdom: respecting natural dangers, taking time to verify information, following established routes even when they're longer, and maintaining equipment and supplies properly.\n\nThe motivation-aligned choice should show how the character's driving purpose influences their approach to frontier challenges, perhaps making them more cautious (if fleeing danger) or more aggressive (if pursuing someone or something).\n\n**Narrative Tone for Turn 2**:\nEmphasize the vastness and beauty of the frontier while highlighting its dangers. This is where many characters realize the true scope of their undertaking. Use environmental details to show the transition from settled lands to wilderness: changing vegetation, wider skies, different sounds, and the growing sense of being a small figure in an immense landscape. The character should feel both liberated by the open country and sobered by its challenges.",
  "TURN_3_GUIDE": "**Setting and Atmosphere for Turn 3**:\nTurn 3 marks the deep frontier - the character is now truly alone in dangerous territory, far from any semblance of safety or law. Common settings include:\n- Remote mountain passes where weather can trap travelers\n- Desert regions with scarce water and brutal heat or cold\n- Native American territories where cultural misunderstanding can prove fatal\n- Lawless frontier zones controlled by outlaws and brigands\n- Remote wilderness areas with dangerous wildlife\n- Isolated trading posts run by unscrupulous merchants\n\nThe atmosphere should emphasize the character's complete dependence on their own judgment and resources. Society is now a distant memory. The landscape is indifferent and often hostile. Other people encountered are as likely to be dangerous as helpful. This is where survival becomes an all-consuming focus.\n\n**Scenario Generation Guidelines**:\n- Present scenarios that demand accumulated frontier knowledge and instinct\n- Include situations where character must read danger from subtle environmental or social cues\n- Introduce scenarios where the character's specific motivation becomes a liability rather than asset\n- Create encounters with other frontier travelers, each with their own dangerous agendas\n- Establish that the character is now skilled enough to survive, but not experienced enough to predict all dangers\n\n**Choice Design for Turn 3**:\nThe deadly choice should represent a critical judgment error born of cumulative fatigue, desperation, or false confidence. Characters have survived this far but might now assume they're invincible or overlook warning signs. Examples include:\n- Ignoring warnings about dangerous terrain or hostile individuals\n- Taking desperate risks to make better time or gain supplies\n- Trusting someone who reminds them of an earlier ally, not realizing the danger\n- Pushing physical limits beyond what the body can endure\n- Failing to maintain equipment or supplies in deteriorating conditions\n\nSafe choices should demonstrate hard-won frontier wisdom: maintaining supplies and equipment despite hardship, trusting instinct over desperation, seeking information before action, and respecting the environment's unpredictability.\n\nThe motivation-aligned choice should show how the character's driving purpose might push them toward dangerous choices, but they ultimately make the wiser decision.\n\n**Narrative Tone for Turn 3**:\nThis is the midpoint where adventure gives way to grimness. The character has proven they can survive but now faces the psychological toll of frontier hardship. Use descriptions of weariness, damaged equipment, questionable food and water, and the constant awareness of danger. The landscape becomes harsher - mountains loom, deserts stretch endlessly, forests grow darker. Encounters with other travelers should feel tense and unpredictable. The character should feel both toughened by experience and frayed by cumulative stress."
